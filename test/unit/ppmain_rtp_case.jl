# Crafted states for ppmain.mod L199-247 (v4.9.7): the TIMES_Demo demo12 init
# checkpoint (test/fixtures/demo12_off_init) given the data no core reference
# run has, so that the paths of L199-247 the core models do not reach are
# checked against ppmain.mod L1-247 run by GAMS itself
# (scripts/make_ppmain_rtp_unit.jl, test/unit/test_m13_ppmain_rtp.jl).
#
# demo12 runs with %BOTIME% 1960 (ALLYEAR 1960-2200 and '0', 242 labels, so
# Z = 2202 at L215). After L1-196 the milestones' periods are 2005: 2005-2007,
# 2010: 2008-2012, 2015: 2013-2017, 2020: 2018-2025, 2030: 2026-2040, 2050:
# 2041-2052, with M(T) = T; MIYR_V1 = 2005. Its past investments are on 2004,
# and its NCAP_START values are 2006 to 2015 (none with past investment).

The cases run by GAMS:

- "pasti": NCAP_PASTI(REG1,'0',CAPEELC) = 1, so L134 sets INT_DEFAULT('PASTI');
  past investment of COTEBIO in REG1 on 2009 (3) and on the milestone 2010
  (0.1: `3+0.1+1-1` rounds), of COTECOA in REG2 on 2010 only (2), of COTEELC
  in REG1 on 2015 (0.5), of COTEOIL in REG1 on 2010 as EPS (PASTSUM 0: only
  removed), of CSHEBIO in REG1 on 2005 (B = M: not moved), and of COTEGAS in
  REG1 on 2012, a past year inside the period of 2010 (L206: VNT(2012,2010)).
- "noff": user PRC_NOFF in REG1: EXPCOA1 2015-2020 and 2030-EOH (two later
  ranges, L235-238), EXPDSL1 BOH-2000 (ends before the first period: L225's
  SMAX over nothing, -INF), EXPELC1 1990-2012 (starts in the past: delayed to
  2012) and 2040-2045 (later: pp_off over both), ELCRNHYD01 2015-2020 (a REG2
  process only: not in RP, ignored); in REG2 EXPGAS1 BOH-EOH (off in every
  period).
  NCAP_START in REG1: CAPNELC1 1955 (before %BOTIME%: its user range BOH-2010
  cleared, none set), COTNBIO1 2300 (capped at %EOTIME%), COTNCOA1 2012.4 and
  COTNELC1 2012.6 (the lead -189.6 rounds to -190, -189.4 to -189), and
  COTNGAS1 2006 with past investment on 1980 (L227-231: the delay is ignored).
- "noff_offthd": "noff" with G_OFFTHD 0.5 on 2005 and 0.9 on 2030 (interpolated
  by ppmain.mod L189), so the thresholds at L224 and pp_off.mod L22 leave some
  periods on: a process starting 2006 is on in 2005 (1/3 of the period), and
  SMAX at L225 has nothing to take.
