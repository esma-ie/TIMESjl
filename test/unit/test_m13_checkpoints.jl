# M1.3 (0): the checkpoint fixtures of TIMES_Demo demo12 reduce_off (harness
# 0.3.0; scripts/make_m13_fixture.jl), made by make_reference.py --only
# presolve with the PyPI GAMS 54.6.1 (no solve). The ppm/ end point is the
# licensed reference fixture of 21 Oct 2026 (GAMS 52.1.0), so the chain also
# checks that the cloud-made checkpoints lead to it: every symbol the four
# segments leave alone must be in ppm/ as the input dump has it.
