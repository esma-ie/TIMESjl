# demo12 variants for advanced TIMES features

Approved by James on 5 Nov 2026. Each variant is TIMES_Demo demo12 (CC BY 4.0)
with a small added DD file that switches on one advanced feature, as documented
in the ETSAP User Notes (`etsap-TIMES/TIMES_Documentation/User_Notes`, CC BY 4.0)
or announced in `Version.log` of TIMES v4.9.7 but not yet in the PDF
documentation. They fill the CI gap that demo12 alone leaves: features only the
large core models (or none of them) reach.

## How a variant is made and checked

1. Read the User Note or `Version.log` entry and the GAMS source of the
   feature (never from memory); write `reference/dd/<case>/<feature>.dd` and a
   run file that is `demo12.run` plus its include; add the case to
   `reference/crafted.toml`.
2. Run the harness with GAMS 54.6.1 on James's workstation, both variants,
   CPLEX and HiGHS (`make_reference.py --suite reference/crafted.toml`).
   Check that GAMS generates every intended equation family (the CONVERT
   dictionary) and that the solve is optimal.
3. CI (`test/unit/test_variants.jl`, registry
   `test/fixtures/variant_fixtures.toml`, fixtures by
   `scripts/make_variant_fixture.jl`): preprocessing from the input dump to
   ppm on every symbol, and model generation refusing exactly the families not
   yet translated, so a feature can never yield a model with rows missing.
4. When a translation change covers the feature, its list of untranslated
   families shrinks; at empty, the variant moves to
   `test/fixtures/public_fixtures.toml` with its matrix and solution (layers
   2-3).

Extension scope (docs/translation-guide.md): core and VDA in Phase 1, DSC next;
MACRO, stochastics, ETL, climate and damage after M1.7.

## Order: the order the features entered TIMES (James, 5 Nov 2026)

| # | Variant | Case | First release (Version.log) | GAMS | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Dispatching and unit commitment | `TIMES_Demo-demo12_uc` | 3.7.0, Aug 2014 (ramping, `eqactups.vda`); 3.9.0, Oct 2015 (linear dispatch); 3.9.7, Jul 2016 (unit commitment by start-up type, `eqlducs.vda`), announced 4.0.0 | `eqactups.vda`, `eqlducs.vda` | made (5 Nov 2026) |
| 5 | Retrofits and lifetime extensions | | 4.1.2, Mar 2017 (`PRC_REFIT`); 4.1.6, 4.6.4, 4.6.7-8, 4.7.1 | User Note `TIMES-Refits-Note.pdf` | next |
| 1 | Load shifting | | 4.3.0, Jan 2019 (`STG_SIFT`); 4.3.6 (asymmetric) | User Note `TIMES-Load-Shifting.pdf`; `eqactups.vda` | with M1.3 change 24 |
| 4 | Dynamic time slices | | 4.3.2, Mar 2019 (varying cycles); 4.4.1, Feb 2020 (time-slice trees, `dynslite.vda`) | User Note `User_Note-TIMES-Dynamic-timeslices.docx` | |
| 3 | Flexible time-slice storage (STSFLX) | | 4.5.8, Sep 2021 | User Note `TIMES-Experimental-STS-Variant.pdf` | |
| 7a | Recent attributes, first batch | | 4.6.3-4.7.5, Jul 2022 - Oct 2023: `G_RFRIR`, `NCAP_AFSX`, emissions on CHP activity, non-vintaged `ACT_FLO`, `NCAP_ICOM` for past investments | Version.log | |
| 6 | PTDF power grid | | 4.8.4, Dec 2024 - 4.9.0, Jul 2025 (on the DC power flow of 3.3.6, Jul 2012) | User Note `TIMES-Grid-Features.pdf`; `powerflo.vda` | |
| 7b | Recent attributes, second batch | | 4.9.2-4.9.3, Oct 2025 - Feb 2026: bounds on absolute power rate levels, OCOM flows from retirements | Version.log | |

Later, outside Phase 1's core and VDA scope: lumpy investments and early
retirement (DSC); logit market sharing (ECB), MACRO-MSA and MLF, stochastics,
ETL, the Climate Module, damage costs; the Weymouth gas grid (nonlinear).

## Variant 2: dispatching and unit commitment (5 Nov 2026)

`reference/dd/demo12_uc/uc.dd`, on the gas plant ELCTEGAS00 (DAYNITE):

- REG1, linear dispatch: `ACT_UPS` UP/LO 0.5 (ramp rates), FX 0.25,
  `ACT_MINLD` 0.3, `ACT_LOSPL` FX 0.1, `ACT_CSTUP` at DAYNITE, `ACT_TIME`
  UP/LO 6 h and N 200, `ACT_CSTRMP` UP/LO.
- REG2, unit commitment by start-up type: `ACT_UPS` FX 0.3, `ACT_MINLD` 0.4,
  `ACT_LOSPL` FX 0.05, `ACT_CSTSD` for HOT, WARM and COLD start-ups and HOT
  shut-down, `ACT_SDTIME` 2/4/8 h up and 1 h down, `ACT_MAXNON` HOT 8 h and
  WARM 48 h, `ACT_LOSSD` HOT, `ACT_TIME` UP/LO 4 h. A process with start-up
  types gets the `eqlducs.vda` equations instead of the linear dispatch ones
  (`eqlducs.vda` EQU section), so the two regions reach both.
- Linear: discrete unit commitment needs `$SET DUC YES` (binary variables,
  indicator constraints), so it waits for MIP support.

GAMS 54.6.1, both variants, optimal (objective 23,961,066.47 by CPLEX and
HiGHS, against demo12's 23,960,685.77): 32 EQ_CAPLOAD, 32 EQ_ACTRAMP, 32
EQE_ACTUPS, 16 EQL_ACTUPS, 40 EQL_ACTUPC, 32 EQ_ACTPL, 16 EQ_ACTRMPC, 48
eq_sdlogic, 48 eq_sudupt, 24 eq_sdslant, 16 eq_sdminon, 16 eq_sudload, 32
eq_sudtime and 16 eq_sudpll rows. TIMES.jl: the M1.3 chain from the input
dump PASS at every checkpoint on both variants (821 symbols); model
generation refuses the eight untranslated groups (all 14 families). CI
fixture `demo12_uc` (as_run).
