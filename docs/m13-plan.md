# M1.3 preprocessing: plan (31 Oct 2026)

Source: TIMES v4.9.7, etsap-TIMES/TIMES_model @ d9a6a25. Translate one file or
block per change, in execution order; GAMS names kept; every function cites
its lines. Agreed with James on 31 Oct 2026; M1.3 translation starts once the
M1.2 gate passes (CLAUDE.md), change 0 (infrastructure) alongside the M1.2
close-out.

## Scope: from the input dump to the ppm dump

maindrv.mod L55-58 (v4.9.7):

- L55: the extensions' `init_ext` (`init_ext.dsc`, `init_ext.vda` with
  `equcrtp.vda` INIT_EXT; `prepparm.gms` is called from `equcrtp.vda`
  PREP_EXT, L55, and belongs to the prep segment);
- L56: `ppmain.mod` and its includes (`timslice.mod`, `pp_off.mod`,
  `preppm.mod` with `prepxtra.mod`, `fillparm.gms`, `fillvint.gms`,
  `curex.gms`, `preshape.gms`; `filparam.gms`, `filshape.gms`, `pp_qafs.mod`,
  the levelising macros `pp_lvl*.mod`, `pp_chp.mod`, `eqflomrk.mod`,
  `pp_reduce.red` with `dynslite.vda`) and the extension stages inside it
  (`prep_ext.vda` at preppm.mod L217, `pp_prelv.vda` at ppmain.mod L615);
- L58: the extensions' `ppm_ext` (`ppm_ext.dsc`, `ppm_ext.vda` with
  `pp_actef.vda`, `resloadc.vda`, `equcrtp.vda` PPM_EXT, `dynslite.vda`).

Plus `cal_red.red` on the equation side, which REDUCE YES needs (M1.1
refused it; the as_run variants of the suite run REDUCE YES).

About 4,200 lines in about 30 files: roughly five times M1.2. The riskiest
part is the interpolation subsystem (`preppm.mod`, `prepparm.gms`,
`fillparm.gms`, `fillvint.gms`): its options decide almost every parameter
the later stages read.

Refused (UnportedError), as in M1.1 and M1.2: TIMES-MICRO / TIMESED
(`pp_micro.mod`), MACRO (`ppmain.tm`), stochastics (`prep_ext.stc`,
`recurrin.stc`), the ETL, CLI, ABS, ECB and MLF extensions, `INTEXT_ONLY` and
`DATAGDX`, and blending (ppmain.mod L1230-1336) unless a suite model needs it.

## Checkpoints (harness 0.3.0)

The harness dumps every symbol at five points of one GAMS run (the pre-solve
run, `--TJL_CHECKPOINTS=1`; reference/README.md), without editing TIMES:

| Checkpoint | Where (v4.9.7) | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input/` | before `$BATINCLUDE maindrv.mod` | run-file patch |
| `init/` | maindrv.mod L55, after `init_ext.dsc`/`.vda` | `init_ext.tjlref` |
| `prep/` | preppm.mod L217, after `prep_ext.vda` | `prep_ext.tjlref` |
| `prelv/` | ppmain.mod L615, after `pp_prelv.vda` | `pp_prelv.tjlref` |
| `ppm/` | maindrv.mod L58, after `ppm_ext.dsc`/`.vda` | `ppm_ext.tjlref` (M1.2) |

So preprocessing splits into four segments, each started from GAMS's own
state and checked at the next checkpoint. A segment can be translated and
checked on its own; the whole chain (input to ppm, then on to the model) is
tested at the gate. `scripts/m13_inventory.jl` lists what each segment
creates or changes on a reference run.

Symbols created or changed per segment (reduce_off, sets and parameters,
`scripts/m13_inventory.jl`, 31 Oct 2026; cloud pre-solve runs with the PyPI
GAMS 54.6.1):

| Segment | demo12 | OTCGEN | OTNYC |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| input → init (init_ext) | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| init → prep (ppmain L1-248, preppm L1-217) | 86 | 97 | 98 |
| prep → prelv (preppm L218-253, ppmain L249-615) | 50 | 57 | 57 |
| prelv → ppm (ppmain L616-1357, ppm_ext) | 76 | 80 | 93 |

## Order (one change each)

| # | GAMS | Lines | Checked at |

| 14 | ppmain.mod: storage | 1061-1101 | ppm |
| 15a | ppmain.mod with prepxtra.mod UCINT: the user-constraint defaults (years, regions, timeslices, dynamic and cumulative UCs) | 1101-1179; 61-77 | ppm |
| 15b | ppmain.mod with pp_lvlus.mod: the UC group maps, VAR_CAP and VAR_COMxxx for UCs, UC attributes levelled, RCS_COMBAL/RCS_COMPRD | 1181-1226; 1-40 | ppm |
| 16 | ppmain.mod: blending (refused unless needed; any non-blending statements in the block translated) | 1228-1333 | ppm |
| 17a | ppmain.mod end with pp_reduce.red (dynslite.vda refused, as in 8b) | 1336-1357; 1-188 | ppm (reduce_off and as_run) |
| 17b | cal_red.red: flows substituted by activities on the equation side | 1-59 | layer 2 (as_run) |
| 17c | crafted case TIMES_Demo-demo12_red17b for the 17b paths demo12 does not reach (cal_red.red L37-38 with an RPC_ACT source; bnd_flo.mod L37-39) (James, 5 Nov 2026) | — | layers 2-3 (both variants) |
| 18a | ppm_ext.dsc; ppm_ext.vda with pp_actef.vda (LVL): dispatching and partial loads, the VDA_EMCB sums, ACT_EFF prepared, inherited and levelled | 1-16; 11-58; 9-48 | ppm |
| 18b | ppm_ext.vda with equcrtp.vda (PPM_EXT): shape indexes, flows kept from the reduction, commodity and CHP availabilities, NCAP_AFX/AFM options; the segment's all-symbols check (resloadc.vda refused, dynslite.vda refused) | 59-169; 64-72 | ppm |
| 19 | eqstgips.mod: EQ_STGIPS, inter-period storage (James, 5 Nov 2026: the families M1.1 left untranslated become M1.3 changes) | 13-44 | layers 2-3 OTNYC (both variants); EQ_STGIPS rows on OTCGEN |
| 19b | eqstgaux.mod: the inter-period storage terms of EQ_STGAUX | 25-32 | EQ_STGAUX rows on OTCGEN; crafted demo12 case (CI) |
| 20 | equcrtp.vda (EQU_EXT): EQ(l)_UCRTP and EQN_UCRTC, dynamic process and commodity bounds | 73-123 | layers 2-3 OTUS9r |
| 20b | prepret.dsc: early retirement and refits — DSC code that OTUS9r uses (found 5 Nov 2026 by demo12 variant 5; brought into M1.3 by James, 5 Nov 2026). In four parts (6 Nov 2026); the family stays refused until the last: | | layers 2-3 OTUS9r; demo12_refit (CI) |
| 20b-1 | prepret.dsc EQOBJ: EQ_CUMRET, EQL_SCAP, EQL_REFIT (EQ_DSCRET and the EQL_SCAP IN rows refused) | 89-117 | the rows of the three families, OTUS9r and demo12_refit |
| 20b-2 | %RCAPSUB%/%RCAPSBM% (prepret.dsc L87-88): the -VAR_SCAP terms in the translated capacity equations (eqcpt.mod, eqcapact.mod, eqpeak.mod, eqcaflac.vda; cal_cap.mod and cal_caps.mod stay refused with their files) | 87-88 | the rows of those families, OTUS9r, demo12_refit, crafted case demo12_refit_afc |
| 20b-3 | prepret.dsc DECL: the VAR_RCAP and VAR_SCAP bounds (and VAR_DRCAP, refused) | 44-84 | bounds vs the pre-solve dump and CONVERT |
| 20b-4 | prepret.dsc OBJFIX and OBSALV, the objective terms (eqobj.mod L39, eqobjfix.mod L214, eqobsalv.mod L26, L105); the refusal lifted | 134-162 | layers 2-3 OTUS9r and demo12_refit (CI) |
| 21 | equserco.mod: dynamic user constraints in the RHS direction (UC_DYNDIR 'RHS', uc_pasti.mod) | 80-106 | TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN |
| 22 | uc_*.mod: user-constraint attributes other than GROWTH (CAP, SYNC, ...) | | TIMES-NZ |
| 23 | eqflomrk.mod: EQ(l)_FLOMRK, market-share flow constraints | | TIMES-NZ |
| 24 | eqactups.vda: EQ_SLSIFT, load shifting (with the demo12 load-shifting variant) | 131- | layers 2-3 TIMES-NZ (both variants) |
| 25 | eqmain.mod preparation and pp_qack.mod: the coef -> pre-solve step, so the CI chain runs end to end | | presolve (demo12 in CI) |

## Parity (per change)

Layer 1 at 1e-9 at the change's checkpoint, starting from GAMS's state at
the previous checkpoint, on the core tier (TIMES_Demo demo12, TIMES-NZ
steady, OTCGEN, OTNYC, OTUS9r reference), reduce_off and as_run, and TIM-bau
on James's machine (results stay there). A change is compared on the
symbols it settles that nothing later in its segment changes (the M1.2 rule
for later files); scratch symbols (CNT, F, FIL, FIL2, MY_*, YK1, Z, ...) only
where the GAMS code reads them again. Branches no suite model reaches are
checked against GAMS itself on crafted demo12 states (scripts/gams_replay.jl).
Between them the core models reach the unusual branches: OTNYC the FLO_SHARE
auto-relaxation (pp_qafs.mod L66-89), OTUS9r the dynamic user constraints
(equcrtp.vda), TIMES-NZ the flow marks (eqflomrk.mod), OTCGEN and OTNYC the
plain objective (OBJ AUTO without OBLONG).

The checkpoint dumps of the public models can be made in the cloud workspace
with the PyPI GAMS (no solve: `make_reference.py --only presolve`); James's
workstation stays the reference of record (`run_references.ps1 -Checkpoints`).

## Gate

- Input dump to `ppm/` at 1e-9 on every core model, reduce_off and as_run
  (TIM-bau locally).
- In CI on demo12: input, preprocessing, coefficients and the model, with the
  matrix (layer 2) and the objective (layer 3), REDUCE off and on.
- Preprocessing timed against GAMS (docs/timings.md).

### Gate checks, 5 Nov 2026 (changes 0-18b and 17b in review)

- The chain from the input dump (`scripts/m13_gate.jl`: TIMES.jl's own
  state carried across the checkpoints; at each, every set and parameter of
  the segment's start dump, less PUTOUT, PUTGRP and ERRLEV): PASS at init,
  prep, prelv and ppm on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run
  (821 symbols, 822 on OTUS9r; at ppm 66,471 GAMS records on demo12 to
  19,186,490 on OTUS9r as_run). TIM-bau: to run on James's machine (local
  log, nothing committed).
- CI on demo12 (`test/unit/test_m13_chain.jl`): the chain from the input
  dump to ppm, then the whole coefficient stage against the coef dump; the
  model from the pre-solve dump with the matrix (layer 2) and the objective
  (layer 3), REDUCE off (`demo12_off`) and on (`demo12_red`, change 17b).
  The step between the coef and pre-solve dumps (eqmain.mod's preparation,
  pp_qack.mod) is not part of M1.3, so the model is generated from the
  pre-solve dump, as in M1.1.
- Preprocessing timed against GAMS (`scripts/m13_timing.jl`,
  docs/timings.md): TIMES.jl warm 3.0x GAMS on demo12 and 4.8x to 5.5x on
  the four large core models.

## Findings so far

- (20b-2) prepret.dsc L87-88, %RCAPSUB% and %RCAPSBM% (`rcapsub!`,
  `src/ext/dsc/prepret.jl`): with early retirement on, the capacity of a
  PRC_RCAP process loses its cumulative retirements, -VAR_SCAP(R,V,T,P)
  for VNTRT(V,T), wherever a capacity term is built: EQ(l)_CPT (eqcpt.mod
  L26), EQ(l)_CAPACT (eqcapact.mod L37, L45), EQ_PEAK (eqpeak.mod L24),
  EQ(l)_CAFLAC and EQL_CAPFLO (eqcaflac.vda L32, L57). M1.1 recorded these
  macros as always empty (docs/discrepancies.md D1, now withdrawn: Part II
  was right). In eqcaflac.vda the SUM over RVP_KMAP(R,V,P,MODLYEAR(K))
  controls MODLYEAR with K (G48): the first reading, a sum over every
  vintage, gave twice the coefficients on the crafted case
  TIMES_Demo-demo12_refit_afc (`reference/dd/demo12_refit_afc/`: an
  NCAP_AFC on the coal input of the retiring ELCTECOA00 and a second past
  vintage, so that one EQL_CAPFLO row has two retiring vintages), and was
  corrected before commit. Checked: the rows of the capacity families
  (EQ(l)_CPT, EQ(l)_CAPACT, EQ_PEAK, EQ(l)_CAFLAC, EQL_CAPFLO) against the
  CONVERT export, both variants: OTUS9r reference (462,456 rows and
  3,048,139 coefficients reduce_off, 337,122 and 2,477,660 as_run; 44,176
  VAR_SCAP coefficients), demo12_refit (2,568 rows, 122 VAR_SCAP),
  demo12_refit_afc (2,578 rows, 168 VAR_SCAP, 10 EQL_CAPFLO rows with the
  term); CI on the demo12_refit and demo12_refit_afc fixtures
  (`test_variants.jl`, `partial`), which also runs preprocessing input ->
  ppm on the new case. cal_cap.mod and cal_caps.mod (capacity-related
  flows, which carry VAR_SCAP and VAR_RCAP terms of their own) stay
  refused with their files.
- (20b-1) prepret.dsc L89-117, the retirement and refit rows (`eq_ret!`,
  `src/ext/dsc/prepret.jl`): EQ_CUMRET (cumulative retirements: SCAP(T) =
  RCAP(T) + SCAP(T-1), the row dated T, or T-1 for a process without
  RP_RTF), EQL_SCAP's N rows (cumulative retirement by the end of life
  of the investment, the cap on its salvage) and EQL_REFIT (=E= despite its name: refit and
  life-extension investment against the host's retirements; FX rows, N rows
  only for RP_RTF = 3). Generated from the pre-solve dump, as GAMS
  generates them at the SOLVE from the data after the DECL and EQOBJ
  clean-ups. `$` binds before the comparisons: `RP_RTF$VNT$BD<3` is
  `(RP_RTF$VNT$BD) < 3`, so the VAR_RCAP(R,T,TT,PRC) term is kept unless
  VNT(T,TT), BD(L) and RP_RTF >= 3 all hold (the matrix check agrees on
  every row reached).
  Checked: the rows of the three families against the CONVERT export,
  demo12_refit (17 EQ_CUMRET, 7 EQL_SCAP, 24 EQL_REFIT; 161 coefficients)
  and OTUS9r reference (2,008 EQ_CUMRET, 660 EQL_REFIT, 8,955 coefficients;
  no EQL_SCAP), both
  variants; in CI on the demo12_refit fixture (`test_variants.jl`,
  `partial`). Refused: EQ_DSCRET (RCAP_BLK, cleared unless %MIP%) and the
  EQL_SCAP IN rows (NCAP_OLIFE), which no suite model reaches. Not yet
  called by `generate!`: the family stays refused until 20b-4.
- (20) equcrtp.vda L73-121 (EQU_EXT), dynamic process and commodity
  bounds (`eq_ucrtp!`, `src/ext/vda/equcrtp.jl`): EQN_UCRTP (=L=, LO and
  UP), EQE_UCRTP (=E=, FX) and EQN_UCRTC (=L=, LO and UP; no EQE_UCRTC,
  L101), from equ_ext.vda L105-106. Each row bounds x(T) against
  POWER(LHS(T),LEAD(T)) * x(T-1) plus RHS(T)*LEAD(T), x being VAR_CAP,
  VAR_NCAP, the annual sum of VAR_ACT over RTP_VINTYR and PRC_TS, or
  VAR_COMNET/VAR_COMPRD where RHS_COMBAL/RHS_COMPRD hold; in the first
  period only the -x(T) term. Checked: OTUS9r, the only core model with
  dynamic bounds (8 UC_DYNBND, all on ACT): 15,962 EQN_UCRTP rows match the
  CONVERT export on both variants (31,881 coefficients reduce_off, 31,549
  as_run); its whole model now waits only for change 20b. A crafted case
  for the branches OTUS9r does not reach, TIMES_Demo-demo12_ucrt
  (`reference/dd/demo12_ucrt/`: CAP UP in both regions, NCAP LO, ACT FX,
  GAS COMPRD UP, COA COMNET LO): 21 rows (9 EQN_UCRTP, 4 EQE_UCRTP,
  8 EQN_UCRTC), layers 2-3 PASS on both variants (as_run 3,270 rows,
  4,513 columns, 18,499 nonzeros; reduce_off 8,732, 9,697, 31,515;
  objective 23,962,064.98 by CPLEX and HiGHS) and the M1.3 chain PASS
  (GAMS 54.6.1); CI fixtures `demo12_ucrt` and `demo12_ucrt_off`. Found
  while making the case: EQN_UCRTC is defined at ANNUAL only, so a bound
  on a commodity tracked by timeslice (ELC, DAYNITE) has no VAR_COMNET or
  VAR_COMPRD term; GAMS drops these empty rows and so does TIMES.jl
  (`gconstraint!`). The case uses ANNUAL-level commodities instead.
- (19b) eqstgaux.mod L25-32, the inter-period storage terms of EQ_STGAUX:
  the charging less the discharging of the stored commodities in the
  latter half of the period (each year from M(T) weighted by
  MIN(1,YEARVAL-M(T)+MAX(0,M(T)+D(T)/2-E(T))) and discounted for losses to
  E(T), over PERIODYR(T,Y_EOH)) is taken off the level, and for an STK
  process the bracket is scaled to the level in the middle of the period
  (L32). Checked: EQ_STGAUX and EQ_STGIPS rows on OTCGEN (8,488 rows,
  10,313 coefficients, both variants); a crafted case for CI,
  TIMES_Demo-demo12_ips (`reference/dd/demo12_ips/`: an OIL store
  STKOIL1 in both regions, vintaged in REG2, with STG_CHRG before the first
  period, STG_LOSS 2% and an INDCO2 output tied to the level), which GAMS
  gives 27 EQ_STGIPS rows (with both IN rows) and 25 EQ_STGAUX rows: layers
  2-3 PASS on both variants (as_run 3,310 rows, 4,599 columns, 18,726
  nonzeros; reduce_off 8,772, 9,783, 31,742; objective 23,960,094.02 by
  CPLEX and HiGHS) and the M1.3 chain PASS; CI fixtures `demo12_ips` and
  `demo12_ips_off`. Change 19 found a closure in eq_stgips! writing the
  row counter (the returned count only), fixed here.
- (19) eqstgips.mod, EQ_STGIPS (inter-period storage, `src/model/eqstgips.jl`):
  two kinds of row, as IPS = {IN, N} (setglobs.gms L154) and LIM =
  {LO, FX, UP, N}: N, for every RTP_VINTYR tuple of an STK process with
  PRC_STGIPS, the end-of-period level = the level at the end of T-1 (the
  activity dated LL-LEAD(LL) before the first period) times
  POWER(1-STG_LOSS, D(T)), plus the charging less the discharging, each
  year discounted for losses to E(T); IN, for V = T = the first
  milestone only, the vintages' activity at LL-LEAD(LL) = STG_CHRG there.
  `SUM(IO(IPS), x)` with IPS controlled is x when IPS is in IO (G14). One
  slip found by the check and fixed before commit: the loss sum is over
  PERIODYR(T,Y_EOH), and Y_EOH is a set of its own, so the years PERIODYR
  gives the last period past the horizon are left out (123 vs 3 on
  OTNYC's 2055 rows). Checked: OTNYC layer 2 PASS (reduce_off 504,698
  rows, 858,299 columns, 2,531,196 nonzeros; as_run 236,650 rows, 557,258
  columns, 1,863,168 nonzeros) and layer 3 PASS (HiGHS vs CPLEX:
  9,656,876.73 and 9,657,725.87), the first large core model through
  layers 2-3; EQ_STGIPS rows on OTCGEN (384 rows, 1,504 coefficients,
  both variants), which needs change 21 before its whole model. Not
  translated: eqstgips.lin (OBJ LIN), refused.

- (1) init_ext.dsc, init_ext.vda with equcrtp.vda INIT_EXT (31 Oct 2026):
  the input -> init segment matches GAMS on every set and parameter at the
  init checkpoint (824-825 symbols, nothing excluded) on the five core
  models, reduce_off and as_run (GAMS 54.6.1 checkpoints), and on demo12 in
  CI; TIM-bau was probed locally (results stay on James's machine).
  `prepparm.gms` is not part of this segment: equcrtp.vda calls it in its
  PREP_EXT section (L55), so it moves to change 6. DSC: no core model has
  discrete or semi-continuous capacity data, so no init_ext.dsc statement
  applies and %DSC% becomes NO; such data is refused until crafted cases
  check L12-17 (`T--ORD(T)` on a subset, `OPTION` onto the parameter
  PRC_SEMI). `$IF DEFINED x` is read as "x has records in the input dump"
  (G1, G35): nothing compiled before init_ext.dsc assigns PRC_DSCNCAP,
  NCAP_DISC or RCAP_BLK, so only DD data can define them. The compile-time
  switches the segment sets (%DSC%, %POWERFLO%) go into `tm.switches`.
  Paths no core model reaches are listed in docs/gams-julia-map.md; they
  get crafted demo12 states run through init_ext.vda by GAMS in change 1b.
- (1b) (1 Nov 2026) Two crafted demo12 input states ("flags", "offrange",
  test/unit/init_ext_case.jl) run through init_ext.vda with equcrtp.vda by
  GAMS 54.6.1 match init_ext! on the 55 symbols the files write, nothing
  excluded (CI). GAMS confirms: MOD keeps the sign of its first argument
  (L124 keeps an 'N' bound of YEARVAL-1, and -1 at '0'); a bound above
  %EOTIME% is capped before L123 takes the lead; L117 removes an EPS
  NCAP_START, which L121 may then set again; the FLO_COST clean-up leaves
  UNCD7 with '' labels (G36). At the input checkpoint COM_GMAP holds only
  the user's commodity groups (the TIMES groups such as NRG come in
  preprocessing), which L65 reads. init_ext.dsc stays refused for discrete
  or semi-continuous capacity data (the DSC extension follows core and VDA,

- (2) ppmain.mod L1-137 (1 Nov 2026): matches GAMS at the prep checkpoint
  on the symbols it settles (`ppmain_head_symbols`, 27 on every core model)
  on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI;
  TIM-bau was probed locally (results stay on James's machine). TIMES-NZ
  reaches the guessed primary group (L59-63) and four core models the
  STG/STK/STS storage defaults. Four crafted demo12 states ("storage",
  "stslim", "nopg", "pasty", test/unit/ppmain_head_case.jl) run through an
  unchanged copy of L1-137 by GAMS 54.6.1 match on the 30 symbols it writes
  (CI). GAMS confirms (G37): `NOT` ranks below `+`, so L61 leaves out ENV and
  FIN outputs; an NCAP_PASTY of 2.5 spreads at lags 1.5 and 0.5, rounded to
  2 and 1; an EPS past investment spreads as EPS. PASTYEAR is not settled in
  L1-137 (L160, L201 change it) and is checked with change 3. L35 writes
  only the QA log (open items).
- (3) ppmain.mod L138-191 with filparam.gms (G_OFFTHD) (1 Nov 2026):
  matches GAMS at the prep checkpoint on the symbols it settles
  (`ppmain_years_symbols`, 20 on every core model: no core model has
  INT_DEFAULT('PASTI'), so B, E, D, M, PASTYEAR and PASTMILE are checked
  here; with it, L200-207 change them and change 5 checks them) on the five
  core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI; TIM-bau was
  probed locally (results stay on James's machine). demo12 runs with OBJ
  MOD, so it takes the alternative objective's periods (L150-155); the
  other four drop ALTOBJ to 0; demo12, TIMES-NZ and OTUS9r pass the OBLONG
  check. No core model has G_OFFTHD data. Eight crafted demo12 states
  ("altobj", "altobj_mod", "offthd5", "offthd1", "offthd2", "offthd14",
  "offthdneg", "offthdeps", test/unit/ppmain_years_case.jl) run through an
  unchanged copy of L1-191 by GAMS 54.6.1 match on the 20 symbols L138-191
  writes (CI). GAMS confirms (G38): `$` binds before `-` at L154; leads and
  lags on T move along the milestones; `ROUND(EPS)` is 0, so an EPS option
  at G_OFFTHD('0') counts as none (my first version extrapolated both ways
  there; fixed). The OBLONG ABORT (L159) is a Julia error, tested in Julia
  only.
- (4) timslice.mod with pp_off.mod (1 Nov 2026): matches GAMS at the prep
  checkpoint on the 24 symbols it writes (`timslice_symbols`; ppmain.mod
  L199-248, preppm.mod L1-217 with its includes, prep_ext.vda, resloadc.vda
  and powerflo.vda only read them) on the five core models, reduce_off and
  as_run, and on demo12 in CI; TIM-bau was probed locally (results stay on
  James's machine). The core models reach three levels, four (TIMES-NZ:
  WEEKLY), external regions (L18, L43) and season fractions filled from
  their children (L45-46); none has TS_OFF, DYNTS, RP_UPR/RP_UPT, zero
  fractions, fractions to normalise or TS_CYCLE data. Six crafted demo12
  states ("norm", "zerofrac", "tsoff_first", "tsoff_later", "dynts", "uc",
  test/unit/timslice_case.jl) run through an unchanged copy of ppmain.mod
  L1-196 by GAMS 54.6.1 match on the 24 symbols (CI); the replay needs
  `$onMulti` (`gams_replay(...; onmulti=true)`), as L34 declares TS_OFF
  again. GAMS confirms (G39): a LOOP's `$`-condition is read element by
  element (L63: RLUP holds the next coarser level only); `SET TS_OFF //;`
  under `$ONMULTI` keeps the data; RS_UP and JS take the G26 pairing (child
  first, parent last). The `uc` case does not make L118's MOD argument
  negative; MOD's sign rule is from (1b). The ABORTs (L24, L74) are Julia
  errors, tested in Julia only. pp_off.mod is split into `pp_off_fil` and
  `pp_off_periods` for its four later callers.
- (5) ppmain.mod L199-247 (2 Nov 2026): matches GAMS at the prep checkpoint
  on the symbols it settles (`ppmain_rtp_symbols`: PRC_NOFF, RTP_OFF, VNT,
  COEF_RTP and RTP on every core model, RVP on OTCGEN and OTNYC, which have no
  PRC_VINT; fillvint.gms L18 and preppm.mod L61 add vintage years to RVP) on
  the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI; TIM-bau
  was probed locally (results stay on James's machine). PRC_YMAX is not
  compared at prep (prep_ext.vda L48 clears it). Every core model has
  NCAP_START (L215-225); TIMES-NZ, OTNYC and OTUS9r have delayed processes
  with past investment (L227-231); none has INT_DEFAULT('PASTI'), user
  PRC_NOFF ranges or G_OFFTHD data. Three crafted demo12 states ("pasti",
  "noff", "noff_offthd", test/unit/ppmain_rtp_case.jl) run through an
  unchanged copy of ppmain.mod L1-247 by GAMS 54.6.1 match on the 18 symbols
  the block writes, PRC_YMAX, TRACKP, UNCD1 and PASTSUM included (CI); the
  replay needs %RL% (setglobs.gms L317) for the QA line at L230. GAMS
  confirms the known rules: `3+0.1+1-1` at L202 keeps its rounding
  (3.0999999999999996), a non-integer NCAP_START leads by the rounded amount
  (G29: 2012.4 gives the range BOH-2011, 2012.6 BOH-2012), SMAX over nothing
  is -INF (G31) and stays in PRC_YMAX. A delayed process with past investment
  keeps the RTP_OFF of its delayed periods (L224) while L231 puts them back
  in RTP. No new discrepancy entry.
- (6a) preppm.mod L1-212 (2 Nov 2026): matches GAMS at the prep checkpoint on
  the 109 symbols it settles (`preppm_symbols`: every parameter its macro
  calls interpolate but NCAP_TLIFE and NCAP_ILED, which prep_ext.vda L66-67
  changes; the year sets; the merged OBJ_COMNT/OBJ_COMPD and UC_COM; the
  flags and defaults; the prepret.dsc and fillvint.gms sets; RTP and RVP) on
  the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI; TIM-bau
  was probed locally (results stay on James's machine). The core models reach
  options -1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 15, the bounds' default 10 (years inside a
  period moved to the milestone), cost options (NCAP_COST, NCAP_FOM,
  ACT_COST), FLO_MARK (TIMES-NZ), PRC_VINT (demo12, TIMES-NZ, OTUS9r), the
  COM and UC merges, and prepret.dsc with RCAP_BND and refits (OTUS9r). %PGPRIM%
  is 'ACT' by default, so %RETIRE% is YES in every run (initmty.mod L454).
  Four crafted demo12 states ("fill_opts", "prep_opts", "costs_uc_ret",
  "nointerp", test/unit/preppm_case.jl), run through unchanged copies of
  ppmain.mod L1-247 and preppm.mod L1-212 by GAMS 54.6.1, match on the 125
  symbols the block writes, the macros' scratch (UNCD7, MY_ARRAY, MY_FIL2 and
  the scalars) included (CI); under G_NOINTERP no macro runs, so Z and MY_F
  keep what ppmain.mod L215 and timslice.mod L71-77 left, which changes 4-5 do
  not keep, and are not compared in that case. GAMS confirmed that an empty
  data statement makes a symbol DEFINED (G40: with PRC_REFIT data,
  prepret.dsc runs on without retirement bounds) and that CARD of a string is
  its length (G41); the GAMS replay now declares such symbols without data
  (`bare`). Refused: currency conversion (curex.gms, no suite model has
  it), %INTEXT_ONLY% and %PREP_ANS% YES, %RETIRE% other than YES. On OTUS9r
  the step takes about 105 s.
- (6b) preppm.mod L213-217 (main_ext.mod prep_ext: prep_ext.dsc exits, then
  prep_ext.vda with equcrtp.vda PREP_EXT) ends the init -> prep segment: from
  GAMS's init dump through every translated step, TIMES.jl matches the prep
  dump on every set and parameter (821 on demo12, TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN and
  OTNYC, 822 on OTUS9r; PUTOUT, PUTGRP and ERRLEV left out, open items) on
  the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI; MY_SUM
  is now kept by `timslice!`. The core models reach the ACT_EFF groups
  (RPG_1ACE on OTUS9r), the VDA fill-ins (NCAP_AFC, VDA_EMCB, VDA_FLOP,
  FLO_EMIS), the PRC_RESID run-down and RTP_CPTYR (every model; PRC_RESID
  options on OTUS9r), COM_LIM 'FX' (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN, OTUS9r) and the
  dynamic process bounds (OTUS9r). Three crafted demo12 states ("vda_resid",
  "uc_bounds", "dynuc", test/unit/prep_ext_case.jl), run through
  ppmain.mod L1-247, preppm.mod L1-212 and prep_ext.vda by GAMS 54.6.1,
  match on 159 symbols each (CI): PRC_RESID options 5 and 15, a year as the
  '0' value, the G_TLIFE run-down, NCAP_AFAC/NCAP_AFCS, ACT_FLO, the
  unit-commitment parameters, UC_FLOBET, COM_CSTBAL, FLO_ASHAR, RPC_CAPFLO,
  cost-neutral ILEDs (NCAP_BND 'N') and PRC_DYNUC with every side and
  option. GAMS confirmed how `SUM(COM_TYPE(CG(R)),1)` counts (G42, L71).
  Refused: STAGES, POWERFLO, WAVER YES, %VINTOPT% 1, GR_VARGEN data, the
  ECB, MACRO, ETL, CLI, ABS and MCA extensions, and UC_ACTBET data (whether
  UC_FLOBET is DEFINED then depends on the DD files). On OTUS9r the step
  takes about 3 min, OTCGEN 80 s.
- (7a) preppm.mod L218-252 (the twelve preshape.gms calls, PRC_MARK from
  FLO_MARK, DATAYEAR) and ppmain.mod L249-328 (RT_PP, DUR_MAX, EOHYEARS,
  EACHYEAR, PERIODYR, the commodity groups and RC, NRG_GMAP, PRC_CG,
  RPC_CAPFLO, the primary and shadow primary groups) match the prelv dump on
  the 39 symbols they settle (`preppm_shape_symbols`,
  `ppmain_topo_symbols`; DEM, PRC_CG, RPC_PG, UNCD7, RXX and the scratch Z,
  F, TRACKP are changed again later in the segment) on the five core models,
  reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. No core model has data for
  the preshape parameters, NCAP_ICOM, NCAP_OCOM or NCAP_COM, a commodity
  group named like a commodity, a user PRC_SPG or a trade process with
  untraded PG commodities; FLO_MARK into PRC_MARK is TIMES-NZ's. Two crafted
  demo12 states ("shapes", "topology", test/unit/ppmain_topo_case.jl), run
  through unchanged copies of ppmain.mod L1-247 and L249-328, preppm.mod
  L1-212 and L218-252 and prep_ext.vda by GAMS 54.6.1, match on 192 symbols
  each (CI): every preshape.gms option (the default intra-period move, 1-5,
  2 without data, 11, 15, 1012, -1), rounding and EPS in the step, the
  group-integrity removal (L272-277), L301, a user and a material shadow
  group, and the capacity-related flows. GAMS confirmed that MOD keeps the
  sign of its first argument (G43). Refused: %VINTOPT% 1 (L245-251). L253
  (`SET SUBT(T) / SET.T /`) is a compile-time data statement, in every dump.
- (7b) ppmain.mod L329-460 (the commodity and process timeslice levels:
  levels a region lacks, COM_TS/COM_TSL, RCS, RCS_COMTS, COM_OFF through
  pp_off.mod, RTC, RTCS_VARC, COM_PEAK/COM_PKTS, PRC_TS/PRC_TSL, storage
  (RP_SGS, PRC_MAP, RP_STG), the shadow levels (RPS_S1, RPS_S2, PRC_SGL),
  RPS_PRCTS, RP_PGFLO, RPC_STG, PRC_NSTTS, RPCS_VAR) matches the prelv dump
  on the 24 symbols it settles (`ppmain_tslvl_symbols`; COM_BNDPRD,
  TS_ARRAY, RXX, PRC_ACT, TRACKP, TRACKPC, F and Z are changed again later in
  the segment) on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12
  in CI. The core models reach WEEKLY levels (TIMES-NZ), peak timeslices
  given (OTCGEN, OTNYC, OTUS9r) and not (demo12), storage (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN,
  OTNYC, OTUS9r) and SGS storage (OTUS9r). Two crafted demo12 states
  ("levels", "offpeak", test/unit/ppmain_tslvl_case.jl), run through
  unchanged copies of ppmain.mod L1-247 and L249-460, preppm.mod L1-212 and
  L218-252 and prep_ext.vda by GAMS 54.6.1, match on 217 symbols each (CI):
  a level moved up and one kept (the count rule of L336-337), user COM_TS
  and PRC_TS (the first timeslice sets the level, G30; timeslices removed or
  left out, RCS), COM_OFF ranges, COM_PKTS moved up and down, a group
  COM_PEAK, a peak commodity outside RC, and night storage at DAYNITE and
  ANNUAL with SGS and STS. GAMS confirmed how L380's nested loop domain
  matches labels (G44). On OTUS9r the step takes about 50-60 s.
- (8a) ppmain.mod L461-611 (lifetimes and lead times, refits, COEF_RPTI,
  VNT and RTP_CPTYR, capacity bounds, the periods without new capacity,
  RTP_VARA with PRC_AOFF, RTPC, RTPCS_OUT with PRC_FOFF, PRC_SIMV, RPC_PG,
  RP_STD, RPC_ACT, CHP, PRC_CAPACT, PRC_ACTFLO, RP_PGACT) matches the prelv
  dump on the 30 symbols it settles (`ppmain_life_symbols`; NCAP_TLIFE and
  PRC_ACTFLO are changed again by pp_prelv.vda, RVP only with TS_OFF data)
  on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The
  core models reach %CTST% **0 (demo12, TIMES-NZ, OTUS9r: G_ILEDNO -1) and
  empty (OTCGEN, OTNYC, with lead times), ALTOBJ 1 (demo12) and 0,
  lifetimes beyond AGE (TIMES-NZ), refits with PRC_RCAP (OTUS9r), capacity
  bounds (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN, OTNYC, OTUS9r), STK (OTCGEN, OTNYC) and CHP
  (OTCGEN). Three crafted demo12 states ("life", "altobj", "validate",
  test/unit/ppmain_life_case.jl), run through unchanged copies of ppmain.mod
  L1-247 and L249-611, preppm.mod L1-212 and L218-252 and prep_ext.vda by
  GAMS 54.6.1, match on 233 symbols each (CI): short and EPS lifetimes,
  rounded and dropped lead times, past investment on a milestone (PHYR),
  refit options, every capacity-bound path, NCAP_BND FX EPS, PRC_AOFF,
  PRC_FOFF, a PG commodity flagged non-interpolated, OBJ LIN (the relaxed
  capacity transfer), %VALIDATE% and PRC_SIMV. The replay now sets %OBLONG%
  (OBJ MOD) as initmty.mod L427 does, so ppmain.mod L159 is checked there
  too. IFQ is 1 unless a region is named like a commodity type (prep_ext.vda
  L71), so the `IFQ<10` branch of L528 is the only one data can reach. On
  OTUS9r the step takes about 4 min, OTCGEN 100 s (not profiled).
- (8b) pp_prelv.vda (ppmain.mod L615, with pp_lvlfc.mod for FLO_FR) ends
  the prep -> prelv segment: from GAMS's prep dump through every translated
  step, TIMES.jl matches the prelv dump on every set and parameter (821;
  PUTOUT, PUTGRP and ERRLEV left out, open items) on the five core models,
  reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The core models reach
  NCAP_TLIFE for RESID (every model), the ACT_EFF filter of VDA_FLOP with
  KEEP_FLOF, ACT_FLO, RPC_AFLO and RP_XRED (OTUS9r, OTNYC), the VDA_FLOP
  groups, FLO_EMIS into FLO_SUM, IRE_FLOSUM (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN) and FLO_EFF
  (OTCGEN's CHP), and the dummy imports out of TOP_IRE (every model). Two
  crafted demo12 states ("flofr", "groups", test/unit/pp_prelv_case.jl), run
  through unchanged copies of ppmain.mod L1-247 and L249-614, preppm.mod
  L1-212 and L218-252, prep_ext.vda and pp_prelv.vda by GAMS 54.6.1, match on
  246 symbols each (CI): FLO_FR copied, aggregated and inherited
  (pp_lvlfc.mod) with its 'N' fractions and RVPCSL, NCAP_CHPR 'N', the 'N'
  defaults of COM_BNDNET and COM_BNDPRD, IRE_BND (NE), FLO_SHAR of a storage
  process, %SHELL% ANSWER and the VDA_FLOP group paths. GAMS showed that
  `OPTION a < b` compares domains as declared, not through aliases (G45,
  refining G26). Refused: TS_OFF data (dynslite.vda, no core model has any)
  and %POWERFLO% YES. On OTCGEN the step takes about 2-2.5 min, OTUS9r
  3-3.5 min (not profiled). The every-symbol check found one slip in 8a's
  code, fixed here: F keeps an EPS (ppmain.mod L526-531).
- (9) ppmain.mod L616-682 starts the prelv -> ppm segment in two probe
  steps: pp_qafs (pp_qafs.mod, the FLO_SHAR checks) and ppmain_dflt (SHAPE
  and MULTI with filshape.gms and filparam.gms, the defaults, the
  capacity-only flows). At the ppm checkpoint they are compared on the 17-19
  symbols nothing later changes, PASS on the five core models, reduce_off
  and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. FLO_SHAR (pp_chp.mod, pp_lvlbr.mod),
  NCAP_CHPR and NCAP_BPME (pp_chp.mod, on CHP models), RTP_GRP, UC_CAPFLO,
  RPC_NOFLO, RPCS_VAR and the scratch change again before ppm, so a new
  replay check (scripts/m13_replay.jl) runs GAMS on ppmain.mod L616-682 from
  each core model's own prelv dump and compares every symbol the lines
  write (34) at L682 (PASS on the five core models, both variants), and
  lists the checks GAMS's QA log shows. The core models reach the sum of
  fixed shares (TIMES-NZ 28 groups, OTUS9r 24), the FX+UP auto-relaxation
  (OTNYC 50, OTUS9r 864), the STG_EFF default (OTCGEN, OTNYC, OTUS9r) and
  the CHP default (OTCGEN); none reaches FX with LO/UP, the FX+LO excess or
  a share outside its group, and none has SHAPE, MULTI, COM_ELASTX,
  NCAP_OCOM, NCAP_ICOM or RPC_NOFLO data. Three crafted demo12 states ("qafs", "dflt",
  "notgrp", test/unit/ppmain_dflt_case.jl) start from the prelv dump, so
  GAMS 54.6.1 runs only ppmain.mod L616-682 on them; they match on 34
  symbols each (CI). GAMS showed that a scalar `$`-condition in a loop
  domain is evaluated per member, so pp_qafs drops only the first share
  above the limit, and that `$` binds before NOT (G46); and that a `$IF`
  with nothing after its condition applies to the next line, as %SHARELAX%
  NO needs (G47). The steps take under a minute on OTUS9r.
- (10) ppmain.mod L683-797 is one probe step, ppmain_tsattr: the commodity
  attributes levelled to COM_TS (pp_lvlfc.mod, `lvlfc!`), COM_IE and
  COM_FR defaulted, COM_FR summed and normalised, RS_FR and RTCS_FR, the
  elastic demand steps, NCAP_AF levelled to PRC_TS (pp_lvlbr.mod,
  `lvlbr!`) and defaulted with PRC_TS, RPCS_VAR and RTPCS_OUT, and
  pp_lvlpk.mod. At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 15-18 symbols
  nothing later changes, among them RPCS_VAR, which change 9 left to the
  replay (NCAP_AF and PRC_TS without RP_STS, NCAP_PKCNT without CHP,
  RPC_PKC with %REDUCE% NO and no STG_SIFT): PASS on the five core models,
  reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. DEM (L945), FLO_PKCOI (L808,
  L817), RTPCS_OUT (L1062, cleared at L1350) and RPC_PKF (pp_reduce.red
  L185, which follows its REDDONE label and so runs without REDUCE too)
  change again before ppm, so the replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-797
  and compares every symbol the lines write (65) at L797: PASS on the five
  core models, both variants. GAMS's QA log shows the COM_FR normalisation
  on demo12 (2 commodities) and TIMES-NZ (16); NCAP_AFS (TIMES-NZ),
  OBJ_COMNT (TIMES-NZ, OTUS9r) and storage processes (all but demo12) are
  reached; no core model has an NCAP_AF bound conflict, nor COM_ELAST,
  COM_BPRICE, COM_BQTY, COM_PKFLX, OBJ_COMPD, PRC_PKAF or PRC_PKNO data.
  Three crafted demo12 states ("com", "af", "pk",
  test/unit/ppmain_tsattr_case.jl) cover those paths, 65 symbols each at
  L797 (CI). The replay showed two things the source does not make plain:
  the `IF(Z, ...)` that pp_lvlbr.mod L27 opens closes only at the end of
  L31, so a value below a target timeslice is neither inherited down nor
  levelled from (the indentation suggests otherwise; only the scratch Z
  showed it, as no such value has targets below it); and L729 divides for
  every timeslice, so an ANNUAL COM_FR of 0 stops GAMS even where COM_FR
  has no record (G48): a commodity with COM_FR needs it in every milestone.
  The step takes about 3 minutes on OTUS9r (2.1 million GAMS records
  compared; the gams_sort! of the large symbols dominates, not profiled).
- (11a) ppmain.mod L800-821 is the probe step ppmain_flo: the eight
  pp_lvlfc.mod calls for the flow attributes (FLO_COST, FLO_DELIV, FLO_SUB,
  FLO_TAX with %11 N, FLO_PKCOI, FLO_BDLVL twice, ACT_FLO with %11 0),
  for which `lvlfc!` became the general `pp_lvlfc!` (all its arguments
  but %6 S2; change 10's calls re-checked), the FLO_PKCOI default of 1, and
  pp_chp.mod. Change 11 is split in two (11a, 11b) like 6, 7 and 8. At the
  ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 13-14 symbols nothing later changes
  (NCAP_PKCNT, NCAP_CHPR and NCAP_BPME, which changes 9 and 10 left to the
  replay when CHP has members, are now among them): PASS on the five core
  models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now
  runs ppmain.mod L616-821 and compares 82 symbols at L821: PASS on the five
  core models, both variants. The core models reach FLO_DELIV (TIMES-NZ,
  OTUS9r), ACT_FLO (OTUS9r), the FLO_PKCOI default (all) and CHP with FX
  ratios and no NCAP_CDME (OTCGEN, 8 processes). Three crafted demo12 states
  ("flo", "chp", "chpnrg", test/unit/ppmain_flo_case.jl) cover the rest of
  pp_lvlfc.mod's arguments (the year-'0' flag of %11 N and its deletions, a
  year outside DATAYEAR, the group and commodity calls of FLO_BDLVL) and of
  pp_chp.mod (NCAP_CDME and NCAP_BPME, slopes below and above 1,
  back-pressure units through COM_LIM 'N', FX with LO, FLO_EFF, a
  one-commodity primary group, the share over NRG, NCAP_PKCNT), 82 symbols
  each at L821 (CI). pp_chp.mod L23 replaces PRC_ACT and L71 clears it,
  so PRC_ACT is empty after L821 until pp_reduce.red L10 sets it again.
  The step takes about 4 minutes on OTUS9r and 3 on OTCGEN (copying and
  sorting FLO_SUM and FLO_SHAR, not profiled).
- (11b) ppmain.mod L823-843 is the probe step ppmain_flofs: pp_lvlff.mod
  and pp_lvlfs.mod (FLO_FUNC and FLO_SUM levelled), FLO_SUM and IRE_FLOSUM
  from PRC_ACTFLO for the processes in RPC_ACT, pp_lvlbr.mod for FLO_SHAR
  (its general `lvlbr!` with %2 ',C,CG', %5 1, %6 0, %7 C,) and
  eqflomrk.mod with RPC_NOFLO. At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the
  8-10 symbols nothing later changes (FLO_SUM only without VDA_EMCB,
  ppm_ext.vda L20; IRE_FLOSUM only without records at %PGPRIM%, ppmain.mod
  L924-926): PASS on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on
  demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-843 and compares
  101 symbols at L843: PASS on the five core models, both variants. The
  core models reach FLO_FUNC and the FLO_SUM levelling (OTUS9r), the
  PRC_ACTFLO sums (all), FLO_SHAR below and above the flow timeslices (all)
  and PRC_MARK from FLO_MARK (TIMES-NZ). Two crafted demo12 states ("ffs",
  "mark", test/unit/ppmain_flofs_case.jl) cover the rest, 101 symbols each
  at L843 (CI). The replay confirmed that eqflomrk.mod L27's `T--ORD(T)`
  is the last milestone (G49). pp_lvlfs.mod L42 runs after L41 clears
  FSCKS and so does nothing, in GAMS as here. The step is slow on the large
  models: about 11-12 minutes on OTCGEN and 7.5 on OTUS9r (the FLO_SHAR
  and FLO_SUM levelling; to be profiled). Profiled: the time went to
  gams_sort! in the two gput! of FLO_SUM, which ranked the labels at every
  comparison; ranked once per key it gives the same order about 140 times
  faster (PR #35, separate).
- (12) ppmain.mod L846-933 is the probe step ppmain_ire: IRE_PRICE and
  IRE_FLOSUM levelled (pp_lvlfc.mod), IRE_FLO levelled (pp_lvlif.mod), the
  trade indicators, the marketplaces and their import commodities, links
  and IRE_FLO, RPC_EQIRE and RPC_MARKET IMP, RTPC of shut-down periods,
  RP_AIRE, IRE_FLOSUM of the activity moved to the PG commodities and the
  IRE_FLO defaults. At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 11 symbols
  nothing later changes: PASS on the five core models, reduce_off and
  as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-933
  and compares 112 symbols at L933: PASS on the five core models, both
  variants. Two crafted demo12 states ("ire", "dist",
  test/unit/ppmain_ire_case.jl) make REG1 a marketplace (two import
  commodities in REG2) and, in "dist", a distribution process, and level
  the trade attributes, 112 symbols each at L933 (CI). The replay needs
  %PGPRIM% as initmty.mod L138 sets it ("'ACT'", quoted, which COM holds as
  a member, L141), now set in scripts/ppmain_replay.jl.
- (13a) ppmain.mod L936-1001 is the probe step ppmain_bnd: the commodity
  subsets and COM_LIM defaults, the trade timeslice and commodity
  conversions (IRE_TSCVT; IRE_CCVT, its reverse from `OPTION RC_RC <
  IRE_CCVT`, which swaps the region and commodity pairs, G26), the five
  pp_lvlbd.mod calls and FLO_BND and ACT_BND from FLO_BDLVL; TIMES-MACRO and
  TIMES-MICRO (L962-963) refused. Change 13 is split in two (13a, 13b). At
  the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 16-17 symbols nothing later
  changes (DEM, which change 10 left to the replay, among them; ACT_BND
  only with %REDUCE% NO): PASS on the five core models, reduce_off and
  as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod
  L616-1001 (under $onMulti, as pp_lvlbd.mod declares BDVAL and TS_BD at
  each of its five inclusions) and compares 126 symbols at L1001: PASS on
  the five core models, both variants. One crafted demo12 state ("bnd",
  test/unit/ppmain_bnd_case.jl) covers the aggregation of pp_lvlbd.mod
  (sums, FX where LO and UP meet, a value at the target and below, an UP
  not covering the target, negative bounds), the rate bounds and the
  reverse conversion, 126 symbols at L1001 (CI). With the faster
  gams_sort! (PR #35) the replayed chain ppmain.mod L616-1001 takes 32 s in
  TIMES.jl on OTUS9r, GAMS 60 s (it took 17 minutes before).
- (13b) ppmain.mod L1003-1056 is the probe step ppmain_cum: the
  cumulative bounds moved from BOH and EOH to the first and last years
  (`BOHYEAR+BEOH(BOHYEAR)` leads along BOHYEAR: BOH is 1960, EOH 2200 in
  the suite), UC_CUMACT and ACT_CUM as flows of %PGPRIM%, RPC_CUMFLO and
  RC_CUMCOM, and the commodities on the RHS of the balance (RC_AGP,
  RTC_NET, RTC_PRD, the COM_CSTNET and COM_CSTPRD flags at year '0' and
  the last timeslice). At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 15
  symbols nothing later changes (RHS_COMBAL and RHS_COMPRD are changed
  again at L1067 and L1209-1226): PASS on the five core models, reduce_off
  and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod
  L616-1056 and compares 140 symbols at L1056: PASS on the five core
  models, both variants. The core models reach ACT_CUM up to EOH (demo12)
  and COM_AGG; two crafted demo12 states ("cum", "lin",
  test/unit/ppmain_cum_case.jl) cover the other cumulative bounds, the cost
  flags and the bound checks of L1051 and L1055 (CI).
- (14) ppmain.mod L1058-1099 is the probe step ppmain_stg: RTPCS_OUT of the
  storage flows, the demand-sifting storages (TRACKPC from STG_SIFT,
  RPC_SPG, RPC_STGN, RPC_LS, STG_SIFT levelled to the sifting level,
  ACT_TIME), the flexible storages (RPS_STG, RP_STS, PRC_TS, PRC_STGTSS,
  STG_LOSS, RP_STL, NCAP_AF), STG_LOSS and STG_SIFT levelled (pp_lvlfc.mod,
  now with %6 S2) and STG_LOSS converted to year fractions. At the ppm
  checkpoint it is compared on the 12-13 symbols nothing later changes
  (NCAP_AF and PRC_TS, which change 10 compared only without RP_STS, now
  always; RPC_PKC with %REDUCE% NO): PASS on the five core models,
  reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs
  ppmain.mod L616-1099 and compares 151 symbols at L1099: PASS on the five
  core models, both variants. The core models reach demand sifting
  (TIMES-NZ), a flexible storage (OTNYC) and STG_LOSS (OTCGEN); a crafted
  demo12 state ("stg", test/unit/ppmain_stg_case.jl) makes a flexible
  stockpile storage, 151 symbols at L1099 (CI).
- (15a) ppmain.mod L1101-1179 with prepxtra.mod UCINT (L61-77) is the
  probe step ppmain_uc: the year specifications through %DFLBL% (UC_T_SUM
  filled in between, UC_T_EACH/UC_T_SUCC on every milestone, years moved to
  their milestones), UC_RHSRTS levelled to the UC timeslice levels (UC_TSL,
  UC_DS, R_UC), the obsolete UC_RHSS/UC_RHSRS, the UC_R_EACH/UC_R_SUM,
  UC_TS_EACH/UC_TS_SUM and UC_T_EACH/UC_T_SUM defaults, the cumulative and
  dynamic UCs (UC_ATTR, UC_DYNDIR, UC_T_SUCC), RS_PREV and G_UDS. Change 15
  is split in two like 11 and 13: 15b is L1181-1226 with pp_lvlus.mod. At
  the ppm checkpoint 15a is compared on the 13-15 symbols nothing later
  changes (UC_R_EACH and UC_R_SUM only without UC_DYNBND, which equcrtp.vda
  PPM_EXT changes them under; OTUS9r has UC_DYNBND): PASS on the five core
  models, reduce_off and as_run, and on demo12 in CI. The replay check now
  runs ppmain.mod L616-1179 and compares 172 symbols at L1179: PASS on the
  five core models, both variants. The core models reach dynamic UCs
  (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN, OTNYC), UC_T_SUCC (TIMES-NZ, OTCGEN, OTUS9r) and
  UC_R_SUM (TIMES-NZ, OTUS9r); none has a UC timeslice level (UC_TSL) or a
  %DFLBL% year. A crafted demo12 state ("uc", test/unit/ppmain_uc_case.jl)
  covers those, the obsolete UC_RHSS, the cost-attribute mapping and the
  CUMSUM/SYNC/ANNUL attributes, 172 symbols at L1179 (CI). The UC_T_SUCC
  year given off a milestone (2012) is kept beside the milestone added for
  it (2010), as GAMS keeps it.
- (15b) ppmain.mod L1181-1226 with pp_lvlus.mod is the probe step
  ppmain_ucmap: the UC group maps (UC_MAP_FLO, UC_MAP_IRE, UC_QAFLO for the
  trade processes in UC_FLO and the other processes in UC_IRE, UC_CAPFLO,
  UC_GMAP_C, UC_GMAP_P through UC_JMAP), the dynamic attributes of COMCON
  groups, RTP_VARP for UC capacities, RHS_COMBAL and RHS_COMPRD for UC
  commodities, UC_ACT, UC_FLO, UC_IRE and UC_COM levelled to the process
  and commodity timeslices (pp_lvlus.mod: aggregated where the UC is finer
  than the finest level of the process or commodity, inherited where it is
  coarser, ANNUAL copied down), and RCS_COMBAL/RCS_COMPRD. pp_lvlus.mod
  carries the scalar F from one record to the next and from one call to
  the next (L17 compares with the F the previous record left), so the
  translation keeps F as running state, in GAMS's loop order. UC_JMAP is
  not empty on entry: with UC_DYNBND, equcrtp.vda INIT_EXT L59 left its
  J='1' tuples there, and L1198-1200 add to them, so UC_GMAP_P (L1201) also
  maps the processes of the dynamic UC bounds (OTUS9r: 1,693 tuples; the
  replay found this). At the ppm
  checkpoint it is compared on the 10-17 symbols nothing later changes
  (UC_GMAP_P, UC_ON, UC_ACT and UC_COM only without UC_DYNBND, which
  equcrtp.vda PPM_EXT changes them under; RHS_COMPRD only with %REDUCE% NO,
  pp_reduce.red L161; RHS_COMBAL and RCS_COMBAL only without GR_VARGEN,
  resloadc.vda): PASS on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and
  on demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-1226 and
  compares 185 symbols at L1226: PASS on the five core models, both
  variants. The core models level UC_ACT (TIMES-NZ, OTUS9r), UC_FLO (all),
  UC_IRE (OTNYC, OTUS9r) and UC_COM (OTCGEN, OTNYC, OTUS9r). A crafted
  demo12 state ("ucmap", test/unit/ppmain_ucmap_case.jl) covers
  aggregation, inheritance and the ANNUAL copy for all four attributes, both
  UC_QAFLO checks, a COMCON group and UC_DYNBND, 185 symbols at L1226 (CI).
  Not reached by any model: L17's true branch (a group already marked OUT
  meeting a timeslice finer than F), which needs a timeslice level between
  the UC's and the process's own that no suite model has.
- (16) ppmain.mod L1228-1333 is the probe step ppmain_blend: the blending
  block. No suite model has blending data (BL_TYPE, OPR), so it is refused
  (UnportedError) when BL_TYPE or OPR has data. Without them every statement
  but one acts on an empty set: BLE_SPE comes from BL_TYPE and the other
  BLE_* sets, BL_UNIT, BLE_BAL and RU_CVT follow from it; BLE_INP is only
  declared (its assignments are comments), so PEAKDA_BL is never written;
  RU_FEQ runs over OPR. The one that acts, the REFUNIT default (L1251), is
  translated. At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 13 symbols the
  block writes: PASS on the five core models, reduce_off and as_run, and on
  demo12 in CI. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-1333 and compares
  198 symbols at L1333: PASS on the five core models, both variants. A
  crafted demo12 state ("blend") keeps a given REFUNIT (CI).
- (17a) ppmain.mod L1336-1357 with pp_reduce.red is the probe step
  ppmain_reduce: RVP and RTP_VARA, then pp_reduce.red in its three modes
  (%REDUCE% NO stops after L11; any other value, unset included, after L56;
  YES runs it all: PRC_CAP, PRC_ACT, the emission flows substituted, the
  flows substituted by the activity, NO_ACT, the FLO_FUNC/FLO_SUM
  substitution, the processes turned off by zero activity bounds, the
  single producers and consumers, RTP_VARA), then RTPCS_VARF and
  RTP_VINTYR. Change 17 is split like 11, 13 and 15: 17b is cal_red.red,
  checked on the matrix. Refused: %ETL% YES with REDUCE YES (L43, SEG),
  dynslite.vda (L188, as in 8b) and %MACRO% YES (L1354). RP_AFB is a
  parameter, so `OPTION RP_AFB < NCAP_AF` stores the number of NCAP_AF
  records (G31). At the ppm checkpoint it is compared on the 18 symbols
  nothing later changes (ppm_ext.vda, change 18, changes PRC_ACT, RP_AFB,
  FS_EMIS, RPC_EMIS, NO_ACT, RP_XRED, RPCG_PTRAN, RPC_FFUNC, RPCC_FFUNC,
  RTPS_BD and RVP): PASS on the five core models, reduce_off (%REDUCE% NO)
  and as_run (%REDUCE% YES), and on demo12 in CI. RPC_PKF, ACT_BND and
  RHS_COMPRD, which earlier steps compared only without the reduction, are
  now compared in both variants. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod
  L616-1350 and compares 216 symbols at L1350 (L1351-1357 are the refused
  MACRO and the log file): PASS on the five core models, both variants. Two
  crafted demo12 states cover %REDUCE% YES with zero activity bounds
  ("yes") and %REDUCE% unset ("mid"), 216 symbols each (CI). In demo12 the
  dummy imports (IMPNRGZ) produce every commodity, so no commodity has a
  single producer and RTCS_SING ends empty.
- (18a) ppm_ext.dsc and ppm_ext.vda L11-58 with pp_actef.vda LVL are the
  probe step ppm_ext_actef: RP_UPL and RP_PL (ramping, partial loads), the
  FLO_SUMs of the VDA_EMCB emissions, the auxiliary flows that may be
  replaced (TRACKPG, FS_EMIT), ACT_EFF moved from ACT to the shadow group,
  the ACT_EFF groups (RPG_ACE, RPG_PACE, the singleton groups RPG_1ACE),
  ACT_EFF levelled to the process timeslices (UNCD7, the pp_lvlbr.mod
  average) and copied down from ANNUAL. Change 18 is split like 11, 13, 15
  and 17: 18b is ppm_ext.vda L59-169 with equcrtp.vda PPM_EXT, and ends the
  segment with the all-symbols check. ppm_ext.dsc exits (%DSC% NO: discrete
  capacities are refused at init_ext.dsc), and resloadc.vda (GR_VARGEN) is
  refused as at prep_ext.vda L38. `SQRT(ABS(EPS))` is EPS (G50). At the ppm
  checkpoint it is compared on the 20 symbols nothing later changes: PASS
  on the five core models, both variants, and on demo12 in CI. The replay
  check now runs ppmain.mod L616-1357 and ppm_ext.vda L11-58
  (`ppm_ext_replay`: the ppm_ext lines in a second file included as
  `VDA mod`, as main_ext.mod does) and compares 229 symbols at L58: PASS on
  the five core models, both variants (OTNYC has ACT_EFF below ANNUAL and
  on primary-group commodities, so the levelling and RPG_PACE are reached
  on a core model). Two crafted demo12 states ("ace": ACT_EFF below the
  process level, on a primary-group commodity and EPS on a shadow-group
  commodity, a VDA_FLOP record at prelv; "upl": ACT_UPS, ACT_LOSPL and
  NORTS) cover the rest, 229 symbols each (CI). pp_actef.vda L22 (SQRT of
  ACT_EFF on a shadow-group commodity) is unreachable in v4.9.7: it needs an
  RPG_ACE record whose group is a shadow-group commodity, which no line
  writes. NORTS on a milestone also zeroes COM_FR there (ppmain.mod L720),
  so the "upl" case sets it on a past vintage: on a milestone demo12's
  COM_FR stops GAMS with a division by EPS (G48).
- (18b) ppm_ext.vda L59-169 with equcrtp.vda PPM_EXT is the probe step
  ppm_ext, the last of the prelv -> ppm segment: the FLO_FUNCX shape
  indexes of the shadow group (L61-65), the ACT_EFF flows kept from the
  reduction (L67-75), the singleton ACT_EFF flows into RPC_FFUNC
  (L86-101), the commodity availabilities (NCAP_AFC and NCAP_AFCS levelled
  and split, RTPS_BD, RPS_CAFLAC, RPG_AFCX, PRC_SC, RP_STL, L104-142), the
  automatic NCAP_AFCS of ECT CHPs (L145-156), the NCAP_AFX and NCAP_AFM
  options (L159-164) and the dynamic UCs taken out of the standard UCs
  (equcrtp.vda L64-71). Refused: RP_FFSGG (L76-83, the stochastic
  extension) and dynslite.vda (L169, %DYNTS% YES with TS_OFF data).
  `OPTION VDA_CEH < NCAP_CEH` (L156) has the same domains on both sides, so
  it copies the values (G34), not the counts a projection gives (G31). It
  ends the segment, so it is compared on every set and parameter of the
  prelv dump at ppm (the QA scalars PUTOUT, PUTGRP, ERRLEV left out, as at
  the other segment ends): PASS on the five core models, both variants, and
  on demo12 in CI (821 symbols). With it the four segments input -> init ->
  prep -> prelv -> ppm all match GAMS at 1e-9, each from GAMS's state at
  its start. The replay check now runs ppmain.mod L616-1357 and the whole
  of ppm_ext.vda; GAMS runs five crafted demo12 states to the end of
  ppm_ext.vda: "ace" and "upl" (18a), "chp" (an ECT CHP: NCAP_CEH 2 on
  ELCTEGAS00), "afx" (NCAP_AFX and NCAP_AFM options) and "funcx"
  (FLO_FUNCX shape indexes), all PASS (CI).
- (17b) cal_red.red, the flow term of every equation under %REDUCE% YES
  (`cal_red!` in src/model/cal_red.jl; `cal_nored!` hands over to it, so
  every translated equation that takes `%cal_red%` uses it), with
  cal_fflo.mod's REDUCE path (L35-50, the balance and peak equations:
  processes without vintages at V = T, vintaged ones summed over
  RTP_VNTBYR) and bnd_flo.mod L34-39 (the bounds of a flow the activity
  replaces moved to VAR_ACT). %2 = COM is an alias of COM, so the SUM over
  RPC_ACT(R,P,%2) skips the ACTCG members pp_reduce.red L87 adds (G27).
  scripts/m11_probe.jl takes `--variant as_run` and sets REDUCE from the run
  file. Checked on the matrix (layer 2) and the optimum (layer 3): demo12
  as_run (REDUCE YES: 253 flows substituted by the activity, 237 by
  ACT_FLO, 92 emission flows whose source is such a flow, two vintaged
  processes) PASS, 3,233 rows, 4,485 columns, 18,375 nonzeros, the objective
  of CPLEX and HiGHS at 1e-6, now a CI fixture (`demo12_red`). The other
  core models need equation families M1.1 left untranslated (EQ_FLOMRK,
  EQ_STGIPS, the dynamic-RHS and VDA dynamic UCs, EQ_SLSIFT), in both
  variants, so they have no layer 2 yet. Not reached by demo12: the bounds
  moved to VAR_ACT (bnd_flo.mod L37-39, no FLO_BND on a reduced flow) and
  an emission whose source flow the activity replaces; translated as
  written.
- (17c) The two paths demo12 does not reach, on a crafted case (James, 5 Nov
  2026): TIMES_Demo-demo12_red17b (`reference/crafted.toml`, files in
  `reference/dd/demo12_red17b/`) adds VDA_EMCB OIL->INDCO2 and four FLO_BND
  records on REFEOIL00's OIL input, the activity flow of a process without
  vintages. Under REDUCE that gives FS_EMIT(REFEOIL00, INDCO2, INDCO2, OIL)
  with an RPC_ACT source (cal_red.red L37-38) and VAR_ACT bounds by
  bnd_flo.mod L37-39: LO by MAX (9000), UP by MIN below (12000) and above
  (the ACT_BND 19584.21 kept) the bound already set, FX (10436.1); with
  REDUCE off, VAR_FLO bounds (L25-27). Reference made with GAMS 54.6.1
  (CPLEX and HiGHS, both variants, OK); layer 2 PASS (as_run 3,233 rows,
  4,485 columns, 18,387 nonzeros; reduce_off 8,695 rows, 9,669 columns,
  31,403 nonzeros) and layer 3 PASS (CPLEX and HiGHS); the M1.3 chain from
  the input dump PASS on both variants. Now CI fixtures (`demo12_red17b`,
  `demo12_red17b_off`). The case found one bug in M1.1 code: the
  EQ(l)_FLOBND completeness check (`untranslated_families`) used an
  undefined `rtp_vara`, reached for the first time by FLO_BND data; fixed.

- (0) The pre-solve run's dumps lack the report-only symbols (the reports are
  skipped at maindrv.mod L114), so the checkpoint `ppm/` has fewer symbols
  than the solve run's; on demo12 the 824 sets and parameters both hold are
  equal at 1e-9 (GAMS 54.6.1, cloud, against the licensed GAMS 52.1.0
  reference of 21 Oct).
- (0) `execute_unload` without a symbol list writes every symbol of the
  compiled program, so the input dump also holds symbols declared later in
  the source, with their compile-time data.

## Open items

- QA log: `pp_qaput` calls write QA_CHECK.LOG and set PUTOUT, PUTGRP and
  ERRLEV (first in ppmain.mod L35, `$IF WARNINGS`, which depends on GAMS
  compile warnings that no dump records; then timslice.mod L81-82, a
  warning when year fractions are normalised, and L101-104, a FATAL line,
  ERRLEV 99, for a timeslice with several parents, which pp_qack.mod L378
  acts on; ppmain.mod L213 resets PUTGRP and L229-230 warn when a delayed
  process has past investment). TIMES.jl does not write the log yet; decide where it is
  translated, and whether ERRLEV aborts are checked, before the M1.3 gate.
  Until then the scalars are not compared.
- Scratch scalars of changes 2-5: ppmain_rtp! and timslice! do not keep Z
  and MY_F (ppmain.mod L215, timslice.mod L67-78). Later loops overwrite
  them in every suite model; only a run with G_NOINTERP and neither a
  PRC_RESID '0' record nor an NCAP_BND 'N' would show the difference. MY_SUM, which nothing overwrites,
  is kept since 6b.
