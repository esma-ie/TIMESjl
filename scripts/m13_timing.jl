# Preprocessing timings of TIMES.jl against GAMS (docs/m13-plan.md "Gate":

#   julia --project=test scripts/m13_timing.jl <reference dir> [--root name=path ...] <model> [...]
#
# TIMES.jl: the preprocessing chain from the input dump (scripts/m13_gate.jl,
# TIMES.jl's own state carried across the checkpoints; the carrying is not
# timed), run twice from a fresh state; the first pass includes compilation,
# the second is the warm figure. Three parts, as maindrv.mod L55-58 runs them:
# init_ext (main_ext.mod init_ext), ppmain.mod (with prep_ext.vda and
# pp_prelv.vda inside it) and ppm_ext (main_ext.mod ppm_ext). The dumps are
# read lazily, so a symbol is read (from Arrow) inside the first step that
# uses it.
#
# GAMS: the profile of one run of the reference (raw/tjl_<run>_profile.txt,
# profile=1) summed over the listing lines of each part, from maindrv.mod's
# include of main_ext.mod init_ext (L55) to its include of ppmain.mod (L56),
# from there to main_ext.mod ppm_ext (L58), and from there to maindrv.mod's
# next include; nested includes count with their part. Unload records (the
# harness's checkpoint dumps) are left out. The run is the reference solve
# when there is one, else the pre-solve run; both execute the same lines.
#
# Timings of the two sides compare only when both ran on the same machine
# under the same limits (CLAUDE.md: 12 threads, 4 heavy runs; both sides run
# preprocessing on one thread).
