# The M1.3 gate (docs/m13-plan.md "Gate"): the whole preprocessing chain from
# the input dump, TIMES.jl's own state carried from one segment to the next,
# compared with GAMS at every checkpoint (init, prep, prelv, ppm) on every set
# and parameter at 1e-9.
#
#   julia --project=test scripts/m13_gate.jl <reference dir> [--root name=path ...] [<model> ...]
#
# scripts/m13_probe.jl starts each segment from GAMS's own state; here only
# the input dump comes from GAMS. At a checkpoint the state goes on in a
# TimesModel of that checkpoint's dump, so that the symbols the GAMS code
# declares after the previous checkpoint exist with their declared data; every
# symbol TIMES.jl read or wrote so far keeps TIMES.jl's value (the dump's
# value is never used for it). A symbol that neither TIMES.jl nor the
# segment's check touched is the same in both dumps (the segment ends compare
# every symbol of their start dump). Compared at each checkpoint: every set
# and parameter of the segment's start dump, less the QA-log scalars PUTOUT,
# PUTGRP and ERRLEV, as at the segment ends of the probe. Both variants.
